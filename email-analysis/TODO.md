What I need
===========
* http://docs.python.org/3/library/email.parser.html
* Only the timespan between the PR request and the PASS response.
* Care not to confuse something like `am primit pass?` with the actual pass,
  here I could validate the email address with a whitelist (tutors) and, for
  safety, a blacklist (the email who requested PR)
