This is pretty much a playground for a future learning platform. As tools
are written, they will also be integrated in a larger application. The goal
is to have a virtual classroom for each student, with features like IRC, email
and git integrated, with semantic courses, a reasoner which can tell the
student which concepts he should practice more, and graphical reports on the
student's performance.

Currently, work is being done on understanding the history of git projects, the
way they evolve, and in case of multiple commiters, the effort each of them has
put into creating a project at hand.
